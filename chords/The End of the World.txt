C   G   Am  G
(Intro)

C                       G         
Why does the sun go on shining?

Am                       Em
Why does the sea rush to shore?

F          Dm            Em         A7  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

       Dm                  Fm  G7
Cause you don't love me anymore


C                      G
Why do the birds go on singing?

Am                     Em
Why do the stars glow above?

F           Dm           Em         A7
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

   Dm            G7        C
It ended when I lost your love


   F                            C      
I wake up in the morning and I wonder 

    G7                           C
why everything's the same as it was

   Em                    A7              
I can't understand no I can't understand 

     Dm                      Fm  G7
why life goes on the way it does


C                         G
Why does my heart go on beating?

Am                        Em
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

F           Dm            Em          A7
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

   Dm              G7       C  
It ended when you said goodbye
